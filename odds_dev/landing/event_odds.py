Extract current Event Odds from The Odds API.

This script reads ALL event IDs from the current events snapshot
and fetches current odds for each event from The Odds API, then saves them
to Google Cloud Storage.

This processes all open/upcoming events regardless of their commence time.
Each event's odds are saved in a separate file for granular data management.
